Performance Portable Opacity and Emissivity library for simulation codes

## API

singularity-opac provides a uniform API for all opacity models, in two forms: frequency-dependent, and frequency-averaged (Plank or Rosseland means), and separately for absorption and scattering opacities.

For frequency-dependent absorption opacities, the following functions are provided
(here, $\sigma$ is the frequency- and angle-dependent cross section in units of ${\rm cm}^2$):
| Function              | Expression | Description            | Units   |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------  | ------- |
| AbsorptionCoefficient | $n \sigma$ | Absorption coefficient | ${\rm cm}^{-1}$ |
| AngleAveragedAbsorptionCoefficient | $\frac{1}{4 \pi}\int n \sigma d\Omega$ | Absorption coefficient averaged over solid angle | ${\rm cm}^{-1}$ |
| EmissivityPerNuOmega | $j_{\nu} = \frac{dE}{d^3x dt d\Omega d\nu}$ | Frequency- and angle-dependent emissivity | ${\rm erg}\;{\rm cm}^{-3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm Sr}^{-1}\,{\rm Hz}^{-1}$ |
| EmissivityPerNu | $\int j_{\nu} d\Omega$  | Frequency-dependent emissivity | ${\rm erg}~{\rm cm}^{-3}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Hz}^{-1}$ |

| ThermalDistributionOfT | $B = \int B_{\nu} d\Omega d\nu$ | Frequency- and angle-integrated intensity of thermal distribution | ${\rm erg}~{\rm cm}^{-2}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ |
| ThermalNumberDistributionOfT | $B = \int \frac{1}{h \nu} B_{\nu} d\Omega d\nu$ | Frequency- and angle-integrated intensity of thermal distribution | ${\rm erg}~{\rm cm}^{-2}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ |
| EnergyDensityFromTemperature | $E_{\rm R}$ | Radiation energy density | ${\rm erg}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$ |
| TemperatureFromEnergyDensity | $T_{\rm R}$ | Radiation temperature | ${\rm K}$ |

    NumberDensityFromTemperature(temperature)

For mean absorption opacities, the following functions are provided:
| Function              | Expression | Description            | Units   |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------  | ------- |
| PlankMeanAbsorptionCoefficient | $n \sigma$ | Absorption coefficient | ${\rm cm}^{-1}$ |

with the following function signatures:

    PlanckMeanAbsorptionCoefficient(density, temperature)
    RosselandMeanAbsorptionCoefficient(density, temperature)
    AbsorptionCoefficient(density, temperature, gmode [Planck, Rosseland])
    Emissivity(density, temperature)

For frequency-dependent scattering opacities, the following functions are provided
| Function              | Expression | Description            | Units   |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------  | ------- |
| TotalCrossSection | $ \sigma$ | Scattering cross section | ${\rm cm}^{2}$ |
| DifferentialCrossSection | $ d\sigma / d \Omega $ | Differential scattering cross section | ${\rm cm}^{2}~{\rm Sr}^{-1}$ |
| TotalScatteringCoefficient | $ n \sigma $ | Scattering coefficient | ${\rm cm}^{-1}$ |

with the following function signatures:

    TotalCrossSection(density, temperature, frequency)

For mean scattering opacities, the following functions are provided:
| Function              | Expression | Description            | Units   |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------  | ------- |
| PlanckMeanScatteringCoefficient | $n \sigma$ | Planck mean scattering coefficient | ${\rm cm}^{-1}$ |
| RosselandMeanScatteringCoefficient | $n \sigma$ | Rosseland mean scattering coefficient | ${\rm cm}^{-1}$ |

with the following function signatures:

    PlanckMeanScatteringCoefficient(density, temperature)
    RosselandMeanScatteringCoefficient(density, temperature)

Note that the thermal radiation energy density `u = 1/c ThermalDistributionOfT` and the thermal radiation number density `n = 1/c ThermalNumberDistributionOfT`.

Internally singularity-opac always uses CGS units, as in the above table. However, arbitrary units are supported through the units modifier, which accepts
function argument inputs in the arbitrary unit system, and returns the result from the function in those same arbitrary units.

Note that neutrino opacity functions also include electron fraction and RadiationType species arguments.

Frequency-dependent emissition and absorption functions do not currently support angle dependence.

A struct of runtime physical constants is provided for optional consistency with internal operations by the
`GetRuntimePhysicalConstants()` method.

## To Build

At its most basic:
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:lanl/singularity-opac.git
cd singularity-opac
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ..
make
```

### To Make tests

Then, in the singularity-opac root directory:
```bash
mkdir -p bin
cd bin
cmake -DSINGULARITY_BUILD_TESTS=ON ..
make -j
make test
```

### Build Options

A number of options are avaialable for compiling:

| Option                            | Default | Comment                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SINGULARITY_BUILD_TESTS           | OFF     | Build test infrastructure.                                                           |
| SINGULARITY_USE_HDF5              | ON      | Enables HDF5. Required for Spiner opacities.                                         |
| SINGULARITY_KOKKOS_IN_TREE        | OFF     | Force cmake to use Kokkos source included in tree.                                   |

### Loading ASCII Data

Currently, the MeanOpacity class, defined in singularity-opac/photons/mean_opacity_photons.hpp, supports
loading grey Rosseland and Planck opacity data in an ASCII format.  An example of this format is
provided by singularity-opac/photons/example_ascii/kap_plaw.txt.  The 1st row of the header has the
number of density points, NRho, then the number of temperature points, NT.  The 2nd (3rd) row of the header
has min and max density (temperature) bounds.  These bounds are inclusive, so the opacity data in the file
should have evaluations at these min and max values.  The rest of the ASCII file is a two-column table, where
the 1st (2nd) column is Rosseland (Planck) opacity.  The number of rows in each column is NRhoxNT, where
density is the slow index and temperature is the fast index (thus the row index = temperature index
+ NT x (density index), indexing from 0).  Each opacity is assumed to be evaluated on log-spaced
density and temperature grids, where these grids are defined by NRho, NT, and the (again inclusive) min and
max bounds the header.
